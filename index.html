        <h3 class="text-center animated bounceIn">WHAT IS <b>SPACE ELEVATOR?</b></h3>

        <p class="pInfo">The Moon is Earths 8th continent, a new frontier for humanity with precious resources that can bring enormous benefits to life on Earth and our future in space. Expanding Earth’s economic and social sphere to the Moon is our first step in securing our future. Not long from now a new generation will look up and see lights on the Moon, and know that they are part of a multi-world species.
                8TH CONTINENT
                The Moon is a new world with a total landmass approximating North and South America combined. The Moon has only been reached by government superpowers, but new advances in technology are bringing the Moon within reach of everyone. Soon we can all set sail as explorers to Earth’s 8th continent, seeking new knowledge, opportunity and adventure.
                RESOURCES FOR HUMANITY
                Like the Earth, the Moon has been enriched with vast resources through billions of years of asteroid bombardment. Unlike the Earth, these resources are largely on or near the lunar surface, relatively accessible. We are blazing a trail to the Moon to seek and harvest these resources to support a new space renaissance, where economic trade between countries will eventually become trade between worlds.
                WATER
                One of the greatest practical space discoveries of our generation is the presence of vast quantities of water on the Moon, verified by NASA in 2009. Water (H2O) not only supports life but its constituents hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel. The discovery of water on the Moon is a game changer, not just for the economic viability of lunar resources, but for the economics of reaching Mars and other deep space destinations. Water is the oil of the solar system, and the Moon will become a gas station in the sky.</p>
